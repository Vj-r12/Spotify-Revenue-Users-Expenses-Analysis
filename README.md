In this Spotify Revenue, Users, and Expenses Analysis project, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to delve deep into the data. This end-to-end project was developed using Qlik Sense, a cloud-based Business Intelligence tool, for robust data visualization. Our analysis involved utilizing SQL for in-depth exploration. Excel was employed for cross-checking and ensuring data accuracy. This repository contains the comprehensive work done during the analysis, providing insights into Spotify's financial landscape.


# Data Preparation

In this phase, we meticulously cleaned the dataset, addressing null values, and ensured data consistency. Additionally, a significant enhancement was made by arranging the data into quarterly intervals, providing a detailed temporal dimension to our analysis. Furthermore, we added an essential component to our dataset: the 'Net Profit' column. Calculated through a rigorous financial analysis, this new attribute provides a comprehensive view of Spotify's profitability. All data was organized into a standardized number format, enhancing accuracy and reliability for our subsequent analysis.
